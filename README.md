### SyMC- a Tool for SMT-based Bounded Invariance Checking of Simulink Models. ###

* Quick summary
* V 0.0.1

### Observations on the run ###

In this section, I will be documenting the observations from the continuous
execution of the early prototypes.

#### V 0.0.1 ####

* The tool runs pretty decent. For checking a run of 60 seconds of the wheel.json
model, we report the following times:
- model generation time: 1716 seconds.
- model checking (SMT checking) time: 2.15 seconds.
- version moved to branch "dev"
